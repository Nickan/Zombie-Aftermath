My C++ 2D tower defense. Powered by SFML http://www.sfml-dev.org/. 
using Code Blocks as my IDE.

I created this game on Windows 7 and decided to revive it using Ubuntu 13.10, 
and the experience is so painful as there are many things that has to be done 
by hand. My aim is to improve my overall C++ skills, polish this game. 

I will provide the needed files (The compiled SFML 2.1) and other updates later.
