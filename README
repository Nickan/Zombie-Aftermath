My C++ 2D tower defense. Powered by SFML http://www.sfml-dev.org/. 
using Code Blocks as my IDE.

I created this game on Windows 7 and decided to revive it using Ubuntu 13.10, 
and the experience is so painful as there are many things that has to be done 
by hand. My aim is to improve my overall C++ skills, polish this game. 

The debug and release folder inside bin folder contains their corresponding
executable files and , tested running on Windows XP SP2/7 SP1 and Ubuntu 13.10.
